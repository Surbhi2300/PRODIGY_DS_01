**Population Distribution Visualization Using Bar Chart or Histogram**

This project creates a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender, in a population dataset. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, it helps uncover patterns in demographic data and provides clear visual insights for further analysis or reporting.
